1D finite square well
The program is set up with the 1D finite well in atomic units. The potential is 3 Bohr radii long and 5*27.2eV=136eV deep.
The solution should be a wavefunction with three bumps exponentially approaching 0 on both ends. The eigenenergy should be -1.806*27.2eV=-49.1eV

Hydrogen atom
Try changing the potential to
  static double V(double x){return -1/x;}
You also have to change xInitial to something small like 0.0001 to avoid division by zero. Finally, uncomment the radial SchroeEqn and comment the 1D case.
The solution should be a wavefunction with one bump exponentially approaching 0 at large x. The eigenenergy should be -0.4993*27.211eV=-13.6eV, the ionization energy of hydrogen.

Deuterium nucleus
Try changing the potential to
  static double V(double x){return -20/(1+Math.exp((x-2.12)/0.5));}
You also have to change xInitial to something small like 0.0001 to avoid division by zero. As before, uncomment the radial SchroeEqn and comment the 1D case. Finally, change the constant from 2.0 to 0.048.
The solution should be a wavefunction with one bump exponentially approaching 0 at large x. The eigenenergy should be -2.2MeV, the approximate binding energy of deuterium.
